- 👋 Hi, I’m @Michelle-Rose
A 26-year-old student at Whitiriea. I am in my final year of study for my Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT).
Once I finish my studies I hope to be a product designer or UX UI Designer or a Front end developer. 
I just cannot decide just yet, just keeping my options open.
I am currently looking for a Summer internship for summer 2021 and/or a full-time role starting November 2021

- 👀 I’m interested in user experience design and info security
In my spare time, I make candles, read Marvel Comics and continuously rewatch the Marvel movies.
I also enjoy playing video games on my Switch. BOTW, DQB2 and Animal Crossing are some of my favs

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web app development using Node Express JS
I am also doing my final school course being the Capstone Project. Where we are put into teams and given a real-world client's project.
Within this project, I am getting the opportunity to take the role of project manager and together as a team we are getting to redesign an established application 
to be user friendly as well as time and cost efficient to our client.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others to be able to make meaningful experiences. I want to be able to take an idea from concept to prototype to production
