👋 Hi, I’m @Michelle-Rose

Dedicated and innovative UX Designer with a passion for creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences. Leveraging my background in user research, interaction design, and prototyping, I aim to collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver products that delight users and drive business objectives. Committed to staying at the forefront of industry trends and technologies, I aspire to contribute my expertise to projects that positively impact both users and organisations.

I am currently looking for next full-time role starting May 2024

👀 I’m interested in product and user experience design
In my spare time, I make candles, read Marvel Comics and continuously rewatch the Marvel movies.
I also enjoy playing video games on my Switch. BOTW, TOTK, DQB2 and Animal Crossing are some of my favs

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others to be able to make meaningful experiences. I want to be able to take an idea from concept to prototype to production
